Hi,

I am Sai Kumar Reddy Gheereddy, Business data analyst at Fetch Rewards. This mail is with regards to the concerns I have with brands, 
receipts, and users data for the past few months. I have the below questions and ideas on the noticed problems.
   1) Each of the tables has its own set of variables that has unstructured or semi-structured collection of data,
      which questions the data collection methods that were applied.
   2) I have found the data quality issues using pandas, a python library that helps in understanding the data.
      I noticed a whole lot of null values and duplicate entries in the few columns. Missing values may lead to wrong decisions if not handled properly.
   3) These missing values can be imputed with proper metrics or based on the generic information from a set of data.
   4) Even after adjusting the data collection, the clean data size seems to grow exponentially in future and needs a scalable solution such as AWS S3 or Amazon Redshift.
Please find the attached data and insights and kindly reach me if you need further information.

Thanks and Regards
Sai Kumar Reddy Gheereddy
